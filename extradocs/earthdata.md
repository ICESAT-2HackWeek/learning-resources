# NASA Earthdata login

### Overview

One of our earliest tutorials involves learning how to download ICESat-2 data directly from NASA's data portals. NASA maintains a number of different portals, but we'll be using the [Earthdata](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/) portal. NASA Earthdata provides a convenient web map interface to a wide range of NASA earth observations. The data are stored at one of several Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). We will be accessing ICESat-2 data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center DAAC.

### Why do I need an Earthdata login?

Each participant will need a login. We will be teaching you ways to programmatically access ICESat-2 data from within your Python scripts. You will need to enter your Earthdata username and password in order for this to work.

### Getting an Earthdata login

If you do not already have an Earthdata login, then navigate to the [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) page:

Enter a username and password, and then record this somewhere for use during the data access tutorial.
