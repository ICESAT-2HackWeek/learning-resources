## Vocabulary

This page explains some of the terms encountered during Cyberseminars and links to resources on where to learn more about them.

### Platforms

Hydroshare: an online, collaborative Hydrologic Information System for sharing hydrologic data, models, and code.


### Software Libraries

Numpy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.

Pandas: Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

Anaconda: Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

### Tools and Methods

Jupyter Notebooks: The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more

Docker: An image is a executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.   A container is a runtime instance of an image – what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.

Landlab – a Python-based modeling environment that allows scientists and students to build numerical landscape models.
