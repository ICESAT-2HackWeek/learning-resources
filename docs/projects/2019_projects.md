2019 ICESat-2 Cryospheric Hackweek Projects
-------------------------------------------

A brief list of the projects (and links to their repositories on GitHub) worked on at the 2019 Hackweek are below. These projects are also tagged with the `2019-project` tag in the `University of Washington ICESat-2 Hack Week GitHub organization <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek>`_

*Python Libraries*

- `icepyx <https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx>`_
    - Originally icesat2py, the `icepyx` library initially began as a Hackweek project designed to bring together code accomplishing similar tasks (e.g. data access and read-in)

*Sea Ice*

- `Floes are Swell <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Floes-are-Swell>`_

  - Calculate chord length (CLD) and lead width (LWD)

- `Segtrax <https://icesat2hackweek2019.slack.com/messages/CKQ08MBBR>`_

  - Create trajectories of sea ice motion (creates Python trajectory class)

*Glaciers and Ice Sheets*

- `Crackup <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/crackup>`_

  - Investigating small-scale features such as crevasses and water depth

- `GlacierSat2 <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/glaciersat2>`_

  - Constrain surface types (e.g. wet vs. dry snow) using ICESat-2 data over the Juneau Icefield, working towards looking at seasonal elevation changes

- `WaterNoice <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/WaterNoice>`_

  - Detection of hydrologic features (e.g. meltwater ponds, firn aquifer seeps, blue ice megadunes, icebergs, etc.) in ATL06 land ice product

- `SnowBlower/blowing snow <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Snowblower>`_

  - Evaluate the blowing snow flag and look at blowing snow models

- `Cross-trak (xtrak) <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/xtrak>`_

  - Interpolation between ICESat-2 tracks
  - Create gridded elevation data from multiple ICESat-2 tracks

- `Ground2Float <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/ground2float>`_

  - Identify grounding zones using ICESat-2 data (using the slope-break method)

- `Topohack <https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/topohack>`_

  - Resolve topography over complex terrain
