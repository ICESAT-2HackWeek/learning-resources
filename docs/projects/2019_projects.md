2019 ICESat-2 Cryospheric Hackweek Projects
-------------------------------------------

A brief list of the projects (and links to their repositories on GitHub) worked on at the 2019 Hackweek are below. These projects are also tagged with the `2019-project` tag in the [University of Washington ICESat-2 Hack Week GitHub organization](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek).


Crackup: 
Glaciersat2: 
Ground2float 
Segtrax: 
Snowblower: 
Topohack: 

*Python Libraries*

* [icepyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx): Originally icesat2py, the `icepyx` library initially began as a Hackweek project designed to bring together code accomplishing similar tasks (e.g. data access and read-in)

*Sea Ice*

* [Floes are Swell](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Floes-are-Swell): Calculate chord length (CLD) and lead width (LWD)

* [Segtrax](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/segtrax): Create trajectories of sea ice motion (creates Python trajectory class). [(video of presentation)](https://youtu.be/VCfZ_9cakJk)

*Glaciers and Ice Sheets*

- [Crackup](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/crackup): Investigating small-scale features such as crevasses and water depth [(video of presentation)](https://youtu.be/QD3_WVZs_jI).

- [GlacierSat2](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/glaciersat2): Constrain surface types (e.g. wet vs. dry snow) using ICESat-2 data over the Juneau Icefield, working towards looking at seasonal elevation changes. [(video of presentation)](https://youtu.be/jTGJOrKuxt0)

- [WaterNoice](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/WaterNoice): Detection of hydrologic features (e.g. meltwater ponds, firn aquifer seeps, blue ice megadunes, icebergs, etc.) in ATL06 land ice product

- [SnowBlower/blowing snow](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Snowblower): Evaluate the blowing snow flag and look at blowing snow models. [(video of presentation)](https://youtu.be/XPjzeTwJ5Tk)

- [Cross-trak (xtrak)](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/xtrak): Interpolation between ICESat-2 tracks; create gridded elevation data from multiple ICESat-2 tracks

- [Ground2Float](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/ground2float): Identify grounding zones using ICESat-2 data (using the slope-break method). [(video of presentation)](https://youtu.be/6n4AJiikmhA)

- [Topohack](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/topohack): resolve topography over complex terrain. [(video of presentation)](https://youtu.be/L5rKZ40EZCw)
