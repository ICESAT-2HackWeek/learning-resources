# Example Projections from the 2019 Hackweek

## Sea Ice    
* [Floes are Swell:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Floes-are-Swell) Calculate chord length (CLD) and lead width (LWD)
* [Segtrax:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/segtrax) Create trajectories of sea ice motion (creates Python trajectory class)
## Glaciers and Ice Sheets
* [Crackup:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/crackup) Investigating small-scale features such as crevasses and water depth
* [GlacierSat2:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/glaciersat2) Constrain surface types (e.g. wet vs. dry snow) using ICESat-2 data over the Juneau Icefield, working towards looking at seasonal elevation changes
* [WaterNoice:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/WaterNoice) Detection of hydrologic features (e.g. meltwater ponds, firn aquifer seeps, blue ice megadunes, icebergs, etc.) in ATL06 land ice product
* [SnowBlower/blowing snow:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/Snowblower) Evaluate the blowing snow flag and look at blowing snow models
* [Cross-trak (xtrak):](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/xtrak) Interpolation between ICESat-2 tracks, Create gridded elevation data from multiple ICESat-2 tracks
* [Ground2Float:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/ground2float) Identify grounding zones using ICESat-2 data (using the slope-break method)
* [Topohack:](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/topohack) Resolve topography over complex terrain
