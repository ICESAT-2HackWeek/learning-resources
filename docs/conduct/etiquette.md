# Virtual Etiquette

Best practices to maximize learning and connection in a virtual space.

Establishing protocols and habbits around virtual etiquette is important early in the hackweek. Whenever a group is meeting for the first time it is helpful to provide reminders on the following points (these could be posted on a slide that is shared on everyone's screen):

* **keeping video turned on**: invite everyone to stay visually connected with their video enabled. You may wish to establish a shared understanding that if someone's vido is off, it means they are taking a break. This protocol can be flexible considering some people may not have a functioning video connection. 
* **mute when not speaking**: this is especially relevant with many households having multiple adults working from home, and children being home from school. Remind participants to unmute when it is time for them to speak.
* **name and location label**: most virtual platforms allow you to show your name somewhere next to your video window. If not already done, teach participants how to update their full name, together with their geographic location if relevant.
* **stating name before speaking**: in the event that people are attending without video, advise participants to speak their name first, as is common in an audio-only conference.
* **chat function**: explain how to access the chat window, and remind people about the differences between chats with individuals versus the full group. You may wish to establish norms around the use of chat. In some cases, you might want to discourage it since it can be distracting.
* **gallery and speaker views**: many platforms offer different ways to view the group of people who are online. For example, Zoom has a speaker and a gallery view. For large groups, gallery may be recommended. Note that the maximum size of the gallery view can be modified in Zoom.
* **security considerations**: The rapid uptick in Zoom usage has led to some unfortunate events, so-called "Zoom bombs" where unauthorized attendees distrupt an existing meeting. The University of Washington has posted some useful [guidelines for protecting Zoom meetings](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/phones/conferencing/zoom-video-conferencing/security-settings/).
