## Overview

The organizers of this event are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age or religion. Hackweek volunteers and organizers will step up to address harassment of participants and/or presenters in any form if we are direct witnesses. 

## Definition of Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* Verbal comments that discriminate on the basis of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Expectations

We expect participants and instructors to act in ways that support a learning community at all event venues and event-related social activities. We expect you to support collaboration and learning while visiting University of Washington's many communities of practice. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to comply may result in the participant being expelled from the event without refund at the discretion of the organizers.
